Subject: Farewell to TCS & USAA (Except the Amazing People I Met Along the Way)

Well, folks, the day has arrived. My last day. I know, I know... try to hold back your tears.

First things first, I want to clear something up. No, Iâ€™m not leaving because of that time I accidentally left my token at my brother's place (thank God he also got escalated!). Or the time I got escalated for sleeping... thank goodness my colleague got escalated with me too. They were blessed to be escalated alongside me, or maybe because of me? ðŸ¤” If youâ€™re curious about those people, please donâ€™t visit where system 206 is located, and definitely donâ€™t ask them if it was fun!

The time has come for me to log out of this system for good. After 1.8 incredible years, today marks my last day at TCS. Itâ€™s been quite the ride â€“ full of highs, challenges, and, of course, plenty of stress. But I must admit, it's bittersweet. Sweet for me, maybe a little bitter for all of you! ðŸ˜‰

Iâ€™ve been blessed to work with some of the best people around. Iâ€™d say Iâ€™ve learned something valuable from everyone here. For example, Iâ€™ve mastered the art of making everything look urgent, even my breakfast, coffee breaks, lunch, and dinner (which, by the way, should always take at least an hour...except for lunch, that needs a little more time, right?).

While I wonâ€™t miss the random shifts (trust me, I wonâ€™t), Iâ€™ll definitely miss the amazing people I had the pleasure of working with. A special thanks to those who taught me the fine art of looking busy while secretly Googling 'how to look busy at work.' 

To the new *nanbargal* who made this journey interesting â€“ thank you for the memories, the laughs, and everything in between. And a huge shoutout to my brother, who has been an unwavering source of motivation with his sage fruitful advice.

For those who still know how to find me, feel free to drop a message. I might just respondâ€¦ depending on the uptime of my relaxation mode. But if you donâ€™t, no hard feelings â€“ Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll both survive.

Remember, every 'unfortunately' will turn into 'Congratulations' one day. Best of luck, and please, donâ€™t break anything while Iâ€™m gone â€“ or if you do, make sure to blame it on someone else! Inner me saying - Break it and learn it. Trust me, itâ€™s more fun that way like one day I did that the last working day of those servers.

Before I go, I wish I could come back, but the cycle doesn't have a handlebar to turn around.

While Iâ€™ll be gone from the office, Iâ€™m always availableâ€¦ for memes, random jokes, or just to stay in touch. Find me at @rknaveen018.

Keep going. Hustle hard. Stay true. Set your heart ablaze. ðŸ”¥
